# RFM Analysis Python_Personal Project 
## I. Introduction
### 1. What is  RFM Segmentation 
RFM stands for Recency, frequency, and Monetary. RFM segmentation is a scoring technique used to better quantify customer behavior. During marketing campaigns, not all customers should be contacted with the same effort. Direct marketin gsegmentation enables to group customers in different segments and analyze thei profitability  accordingly.
- Recency: the last order of customer sinces the last day they made a purchase.
- Frequency: is the number of purchase in a given period of  time.
- Monetary: is the total amount of money a customer spend in that given period.

### 2. Business questions
- The Marketing Department needs to classify the segments of each customer to deploy each marketing program suitable for each customer group.
- The Marketing Director also proposed a plan to use the RFM model in Python to segment customers, and then launch marketing campaigns to thank customers for supporting the company over the past time. As well as exploit potential customers to become loyal customers.
- Suggestions to the Marketing and Sales team with the company's retail model, which of the three indicators R, F, and M should be most interested in?

# II. Insights
- The majority of customers fall under the category of "Potential Loyalists," and because they are a loyal client base, special holiday promotions should be offered to them.
- The second fraction belongs to the group "At Risk," which is the group most likely to quit. In order to identify the root of the problem and develop a workable solution, a survey of this group is required.
- The customer file in the "Lost customers" group is one that has never returned, hence it is not included in the goal.
- In order to convert this group of consumers into potential customers, the "need attention" group needs to provide better customer service to better understand their needs and problems.
- Since the "Champions" group consists of devoted and enduring clients, it is vital to provide a robust advertising strategy and perhaps even include presents as a means of saying "thank you" to them.
- The "Promising" group is a promising client, so it is important to thoroughly review this customer file, see the group's primary products, and run a program where you can obtain one product for free. The "Loyal" group is comparable to the "Champion" group.
